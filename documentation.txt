///—— Description of functions ——///

charToInt : A function which takes ‘0’,’1’,…,’9’ and returns 0,1,…,9 respectively.

intToChar : A function which takes 0,1,…,9 and returns ‘0’,’1’,…,’9’

stringToInt : A function which converts and int to string

Substring : A function which returns a substring of s of length “length” starting from 	start

node : a structure used in linked list implementation of stack

Stack : class used to represent stack

judge : a function used to check whether a given input sequence should be accepted or rejected

printReverse : a function to print in reverse order the rules used in an accepted input sequence

main : takes input and calls the functions judge and printReverse to do tasks
	rules stored in a 2 dimensional array of strings. rules is a pointer to 
	pointer-to-string and it points to first element of a pointer-to-string array.
	dummyRules2 stores rules as given for use by printReverse.
	symbols are stored in an array of string. symbols is a pointer-to-string.
	using symbols dummyrules are converted to rules.
	lookup table is stored as a 2 dimensional array. lookuptable is a ponter to
	pointer-to-string.
	all memory is freed using delete in the end.

///—— Time Complexity of functions ——///

- Reading input takes time proportional to the size of the input

- judge takes time proportional to the size of inputsequence

- printreverse takes time proportional to the number of rules applied
